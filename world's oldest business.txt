1. The oldest business in the world
The entrance to St. Peter Stiftskeller, a restaurant in Saltzburg, Austria. The sign over the entrance shows "803" - the year the business opened.

An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the company survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this really well and last for hundreds of years.

BusinessFinancing.co.uk researched the oldest company that is still in business in (almost) every country and compiled the results into a dataset. In this project, you'll explore that dataset to see what they found.

The database contains three tables.

categories
column	type	meaning
category_code	varchar	Code for the category of the business.
category	varchar	Description of the business category.

countries
column	type	meaning
country_code	varchar	ISO 3166-1 3-letter country code.
country	varchar	Name of the country.
continent	varchar	Name of the continent that the country exists in.

businesses
column	type	meaning
business	varchar	Name of the business.
year_founded	int	Year the business was founded.
category_code	varchar	Code for the category of the business.
country_code	char	ISO 3166-1 3-letter country code.

%%sql 
postgresql:///oldestbusinesses
 
-- Select the oldest and newest founding years from the businesses table
SELECT MIN(year_founded), MAX(year_founded)
    FROM businesses;

1 rows affected.
min	max
578	1999


2. How many businesses were founded before 1000?
Wow! That's a lot of variation between countries. In one country, the oldest business was only founded in 1999. By contrast, the oldest business in the world was founded back in 578. That's pretty incredible that a business has survived for more than a millennium.

I wonder how many other businesses there are like that.

%%sql

-- Get the count of rows in businesses where the founding year was before 1000
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM businesses
WHERE year_founded < 1000;
 * postgresql:///oldestbusinesses
1 rows affected.
count
6

3. Which businesses were founded before 1000?
Having a count is all very well, but I'd like more detail. Which businesses have been around for more than a millennium?

%%sql

-- Select all columns from businesses where the founding year was before 1000
-- Arrange the results from oldest to newest
SELECT *
FROM businesses
WHERE year_founded<1000
ORDER BY year_founded;
 * postgresql:///oldestbusinesses
6 rows affected.

business	year_founded	category_code	country_code
Kongo Gumi	578	CAT6	JPN
St. Peter Stifts Kulinarium	803	CAT4	AUT
Staffelter Hof Winery	862	CAT9	DEU
Monnaie de Paris 	864	CAT12	FRA
The Royal Mint	886	CAT12	GBR
Sean's Bar	900	CAT4	IRL


4. Exploring the categories
Now we know that the oldest, continuously operating company in the world is called Kongō Gumi. But was does that company do? The category codes in the businesses table aren't very helpful: the descriptions of the categories are stored in the categories table.

This is a common problem: for data storage, it's better to keep different types of data in different tables, but for analysis, you want all the data in one place. To solve this, you'll have to join the two tables together.

%%sql

-- Select business name, founding year, and country code from businesses; and category from categories
-- where the founding year was before 1000, arranged from oldest to newest
SELECT business,year_founded,businesses.country_code,category
FROM businesses 
INNER JOIN categories ON 
           businesses.category_code = categories.category_code
WHERE year_founded < 1000
ORDER BY year_founded;
 * postgresql:///oldestbusinesses
6 rows affected.
business	year_founded	country_code	category
Kongō Gumi	578	JPN	Construction
St. Peter Stifts Kulinarium	803	AUT	Cafés, Restaurants & Bars
Staffelter Hof Winery	862	DEU	Distillers, Vintners, & Breweries
Monnaie de Paris 	864	FRA	Manufacturing & Production
The Royal Mint	886	GBR	Manufacturing & Production
Sean's Bar	900	IRL	Cafés, Restaurants & Bars



5. Counting the categories
With that extra detail about the oldest businesses, we can see that Kongō Gumi is a construction company. In that list of six businesses, we also see a café, a winery, and a bar. The two companies recorded as "Manufacturing and Production" are both mints. That is, they produce currency.

I'm curious as to what other industries constitute the oldest companies around the world, and which industries are most common.

%%sql

-- Select the category and count of category (as "n")
-- arranged by descending count, limited to 10 most common categories
SELECT cat.category,COUNT(cat.category) AS n
FROM businesses AS bus
INNER JOIN categories AS cat ON 
           bus.category_code = cat.category_code
GROUP BY cat.category
ORDER BY n DESC
LIMIT 10;


 * postgresql:///oldestbusinesses
10 rows affected.
category	n
Banking & Finance	37
Distillers, Vintners, & Breweries	22
Aviation & Transport	19
Postal Service	16
Manufacturing & Production	15
Media	7
Agriculture	6
Cafés, Restaurants & Bars	6
Food & Beverages	6
Tourism & Hotels	4


6. Oldest business by continent
It looks like "Banking & Finance" is the most popular category. Maybe that's where you should aim if you want to start a thousand-year business.

One thing we haven't looked at yet is where in the world these really old businesses are. To answer these questions, we'll need to join the businesses table to the countries table. Let's start by asking how old the oldest business is on each continent.

%%sql

-- Select the oldest founding year (as "oldest") from businesses, 
-- and continent from countries
-- for each continent, ordered from oldest to newest 
SELECT MIN(bus.year_founded) AS oldest,country.continent
FROM businesses AS bus
INNER JOIN countries AS country ON 
           bus.country_code = country.country_code
GROUP BY country.continent
ORDER BY oldest;
 * postgresql:///oldestbusinesses
6 rows affected.
oldest	continent
578	Asia
803	Europe
1534	North America
1565	South America
1772	Africa
1809	Oceania


7. Joining everything for further analysis
Interesting. There's a jump in time from the older businesses in Asia and Europe to the 16th Century oldest businesses in North and South America, then to the 18th and 19th Century oldest businesses in Africa and Oceania.

As mentioned earlier, when analyzing data it's often really helpful to have all the tables you want access to joined together into a single set of results that can be analyzed further. Here, that means we need to join all three tables.

%%sql

-- Select the business, founding year, category, country, and continent
SELECT bus.business,bus.year_founded,cat.category,cnt.country,cnt.continent
FROM businesses AS bus
INNER JOIN categories AS cat ON 
           bus.category_code = cat.category_code
INNER JOIN countries AS cnt ON 
           bus.country_code = cnt.country_code;
 * postgresql:///oldestbusinesses

8. Counting categories by continent
Having businesses joined to categories and countries together means we can ask questions about both these things together. For example, which are the most common categories for the oldest businesses on each continent?

%%sql

-- Count the number of businesses in each continent and category
SELECT cnt.continent,cat.category,COUNT(*) AS n
FROM businesses AS bus
INNER JOIN categories AS cat ON 
           bus.category_code = cat.category_code
INNER JOIN countries AS cnt ON 
           bus.country_code = cnt.country_code
GROUP BY cnt.continent,cat.category;  
 * postgresql:///oldestbusinesses

9. Filtering counts by continent and category
Combining continent and business category led to a lot of results. It's difficult to see what is important. To trim this down to a manageable size, let's restrict the results to only continent/category pairs with a high count.

%%sql

-- Repeat that previous query, filtering for results having a count greater than 5
SELECT cnt.continent, cat.category, COUNT(*) AS n
    FROM businesses AS bus
    INNER JOIN categories as cat
        ON bus.category_code = cat.category_code
    INNER JOIN countries as cnt
        ON bus.country_code = cnt.country_code
    GROUP BY cnt.continent, cat.category
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
    ORDER BY n DESC;
 * postgresql:///oldestbusinesses
7 rows affected.
